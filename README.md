Transformers TCG Deck and Flip Simulator!

* What are the chances of flipping N white pips given my specific deck list? 
* How much extra damage, on average, does a Flamethrower do in my deck?
* Is there a deck list where Shock Absorbers is better than Reinforced Plating?

Looking to answer all these questions and more!

I'm looking for any and all collaborators. Do you play Transformers TCG and know Java? Do you play Transformers TCG and have burning probability questions? Come on down!
